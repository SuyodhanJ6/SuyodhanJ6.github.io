Thank you for visiting my academic webpage! If you are interested in checking out my blog, click <a href="https://mohitjain.me/">here</a>.

I am currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="https://www.pinterest.com>"> Pinterest </a>.

I have a master's in Computer Science Masters with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence from the University of California, San Diego. During my master's I worked closely with Prof. <a href="https://xiaolonw.github.io/"> Xiaolong Wang </a> on Sim2Real transfer and generalization in robotics resulting in 2 research publications in major internation jounrals.

I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee in 2020, with major in Electrical Engineering. During Fall 2019 I spent a semester abroad at the University of Maryland, College Park doing research with Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~abhinav/">Abhinav Shrivastava </a>.

I am astounded by us humans' abilities to adapt. We are the only species that can circumnavigate the world and now live even in the most remote corners of our beautiful planet. I believe that for machines and robots to work efficiently in our daily life they must be able to adapt fast and safely. I want to develop artificial intelligence methods that would allow robots to <b>generalize</b> and <b>adapt</b> to novel surroundings and continuously learn over their lifetime. My interests lie broadly at the intersection of <b>Reinforcement Learning</b>, <b>Computer Vision</b>, and <b>Robotics</b>.
